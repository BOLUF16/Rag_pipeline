RAG pipeline designed to automate the ingestion, processing, and embedding of new PDFs into a MongoDB vector store using Airflow. Every 5 minutes, the pipeline checks for unprocessed PDFs in a specified directory, splits them into chunks using PyPDFLoader, and generates embeddings with Hugging Face's API. These embeddings are stored in MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch, where a search index is created if it doesn't already exist. Processed files are logged to avoid reprocessing, ensuring efficient document handling and real-time updates.
